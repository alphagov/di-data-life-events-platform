# Vulnerability management and suppression

## Where are they shown?

All the vulnerabilities will be listed in our Security Hub findings in AWS. This is
found [here](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/home?region=eu-west-2#/findings?search=Region%3Deu-west-2%26WorkflowStatus%3D%255Coperator%255C%253AEQUALS%255C%253ANEW%26WorkflowStatus%3D%255Coperator%255C%253AEQUALS%255C%253ANOTIFIED%26RecordState%3D%255Coperator%255C%253AEQUALS%255C%253AACTIVE).

For these vulnerabilities, we should be either be solving them, or suppressing them if we believe them not to be an
issue for our use case.

## How to solve them?

If you click the title in the findings table, a side panel shows up with some extra details for the finding.

If this is a SecurityHub finding and not an issue with an image, there will be an expandable section
called `Remediation` which contains a link on how to solve this specific issue.

If this is an Inspector finding, the Remediation section will not contain anything helpful, and instead the
vulnerability will need to be investigated and solved or suppressed after that. The `Vulnerability details` section
contains a link to the vulnerability details from whichever vulnerability database it was reported in.

## How to suppress them?

We have programmatic suppression of our Security Hub findings in our codebase, to allow for a good management and
awareness of what has been suppressed. This list of suppressions is stored
in `ci/updata_securityhub_suppressions/suppressions.yml` and uploaded by a GitHub workflow. The format of the
suppressions in that file is:

- The key of the item is the Title of the finding
- The resources is a list of resources (matched by regex) that this suppression for this title will apply to
- The notes is a string to add to these suppressions for context or to mark the ticket tracking it
