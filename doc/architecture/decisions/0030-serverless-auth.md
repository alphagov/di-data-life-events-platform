# 30. Serverless Auth

## Status

Proposed

## Context

With our alignment work with DI and the new architecture, we have had to rebuild our auth services for the new platform.
However, there were no issues with our previous approach, and its wider approach is still appropriate for our service,
so we will be going ahead with a similar approach.

## Approach

We will have 2 separate approaches both based around the logic of having boundaries that we authenticate at, but
different for the supplying of data, and the acquiring of data. For data supplied to the system, our boundary will be
our API Gateway, all data supplied will enter the system via API Gateway. For data acquired from the system, the
boundary is the SQS queues that the acquirers will pull data off of.

### Suppliers

We will have an API Gateway with a custom lambda authoriser. This lambda will authenticate the request against Cognito
using `client_credentials` based token auth and authorise it based on the scope claim in the token and the endpoint
being targeted.

An OAuth2 JWT will be generated by the supplier using Cognito's token endpoints, and will contain the requisite scope
for the supplier to access the endpoint. This token will be passed in the request in a bearer Authorization header.
The lambda authoriser will strip the token from the header, verify its signature against a Cognito user pool, and then
validate that the request can go to the endpoint it is targeting based on the scope claim on the token. If the scope is
correct then the request will pass through. The scope is set per client, so will be specific to each supplier.

### Acquirers

Our acquirers will be consuming from our SQS queues, using AWS resource policies. Acquirers will simply need to provide
us with the AWS account and role arn that they would like to have access. The queue that the acquirer will consume will
then have resource policies that allow that role to consume from it, and the KMS key that encrypts that queue will have
a similar resource policy to allow that role to decrypt the queue using it.

### Adaptors

For some of our use cases, we will need to provide adaptors to this flow to allow for other methods of acquiring and
supplying data. For these adaptors, they will exist on top of the existing flow, and the boundaries described above will
still be in place.

The only current case we are planning on is the GRO file transfer. In this case, we will have authenticated and
authorised the data by the time it arrives in our S3 bucket. After that the Step Function that will be processing the
file will act as a supplier and will auth against the API in the normal way.
