# 19. Vulnerability scanning

[Next >>](9999-end.md)

Date: 2023-03-16

## Status

Draft for discussion

## Context

We currently use Trivy for our vulnerability scanning. It is used to scan all new dependencies added, through our pull
requests, and also on a scheduled job for any new vulnerabilities found in our dependencies. We chose this method as it
gave us a single point for all our vulnerability scanning.

However, this approach does not scan all of our dependant containers, for example our xray sidecar, so we need a new
approach.

We also have now added in security hub into our AWS account, and will be using this as a centralised point for security.

## Approach

As we now have Security Hub, we will now be using this as our central point for discovering new vulnerabilities in
existing dependencies. All of our containers that we run, will now be gotten from our ECR, which will have continuous
scanning. This continuous scanning will then output its findings into security hub, so we can see all the new
developments there.

For our new dependencies, we will still have Trivy scanning in our pull requests, as this will prevent the addition of
new vulnerabilities.
