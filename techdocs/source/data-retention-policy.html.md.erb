## Purpose and scope
This data retention policy has been established to prevent the loss of data when there are processing issues, whilst
minimising the amount of time the Life Events Platform holds any data for.

This policy covers:

- Source queue retention periods
- Dead letter queue retention periods
- Alarms
- Audit Logs

## Queue retention periods
These queues handle records received from the GRO. This data is not anonymised, and contains the full payload made
available to DWP.

All __source queues__ have a maximum retention period of 7 calendar days.

The expected retention time period required is much lower than this - less than 5 minutes.

A maximum retention period of 7 days has been set so that there is sufficient time to resolve an issue before any data
is lost, taking into account long bank holiday weekends (E.g. Easter or Christmas), which would reduce time available to
resolve an issue, if detected.

For example, if the system encountered an issue at 9pm on the Thursday before the 4 day Easter weekend, due to Good
Friday and Easter Monday bank holidays, the team would not see that there is an issue until 4.5 days after the issues
originally occurred. The 7 day retention period would enable a team, in this circumstance, to have 2 full working days
to solve the issue before data is lost.

__Dead letter queues__ hold any messages that error on delivery or processing. The retention period of the dead letter
queues is 14 calendar days.

This time period is measured from when a message is first put on a source queue. Messages will only end up on this queue
when there is an issue with the system, so we have given a 14 day retention period to allow the team to fix any
problems. Since messages may spend up to 7 days on the source queue before moving to the dead letter queue, the
reasoning for this time period is as above - it allows the team sufficient time to identify and fix issues even around
Bank Holidays and Christmas.

Under normal circumstances, data will not go to the dead letter queues. The presence of data on the dead letter queues
indicates a problem, which would be addressed as a priority by the team. The expected retention is therefore much less
than 14 days, at around 2 working days to resolve the majority of issues.

## Queue alarms
We have set up alarms to notify the team if any message is on a queue longer than expected, or if a message errors. This
allows us to work on any issues as soon as we can see they are causing an effect on the delivery of messages, and
minimises the time the queue is in this state, and hence reduces the necessary maximum retention period.

Alarms have been configured for the following scenarios:

- When there has been a message on the delivery source queue for 1 day
- When there has been a message on the delivery source queue for 3 days
- When there has been a message on the processing source queue for 1 minute
- When any message is put on a dead letter queue (DLQ)

These thresholds reflect the expected working behaviour of the system.

## Audit Logs
Anonymised data is sent to the audit queue. This data is held for 7 years, in line with GOV.UK One Login policy on audit
logs. The audit logs contain cryptographic hashes of the data received from GRO and sent to DWP, as well as record
identifiers. It is not possible to recover the original data from the hashes. These logs do not contain information such
as name or date of death received from GRO.

We also store access and change logs (CloudTrail logs and S3 Bucket access logs) for the AWS account in which the
processing occurs.

These logs are captured and stored to aid in any internal investigation into malfunction of the system, fraudulent
activity or unauthorised access. They would also be used to assist DWP or GRO in any investigation that may occur, or
the servicing of any complaints.

The 7 year retention policy has been chosen as it is considered unlikely that an investigation would be required for
data processed longer than 7 years ago.

## Exceptions process
While we expect to be able to resolve the vast majority of issues within the retention periods set out above, it is
possible that some fixes will take longer than this. Under these circumstances, we will record the source identifiers
and record dates of any data we have been unable to successfully process. This information will be used to trigger
redelivery of the affected records from GRO once the processing issue is resolved. We will not record details such as
name or date of death of the affected records. This allows us to process the records without data loss, while not
exceeding the retention periods set out above.

In the event that the above exceptions process is enacted, both GRO and DWP will be informed.
