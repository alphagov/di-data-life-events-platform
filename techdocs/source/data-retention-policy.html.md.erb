# Data Retention Policy

We want to prevent the loss of data when there are processing issues, whilst minimising the amount of time we hold any
data for.

## Maximum Retention Periods

All of our source queues have a maximum retention period of 7 days. This is to allow for any processing issues to be
identified in the event of problems over bank holidays, or periods of low team availability.

Our dead letter queues have a retention period of 14 days, to maximise the time allowed to fix any issues causing
message delivery (or processing) to fail.


## Alarms

### Delivery Queues

There is an alarm for when the oldest message on the source queue has reached 1 day, and a further alarm when there has
been a message on the source queue for 3 days.

There is an alarm for when any message is put on the DLQ.

### Processing Queues

We have an alarm when a message is on the source processing queue for more than 1 hour, and when any message is put on
the DLQ.
