# About the GDX Platform

<%= warning_text("GDX is not a live service. All data is synthetic test data.") %>

The GDX (Government Data Exchange) platform is intended to test concepts related to cross government data sharing of
citizen life events. It explores the use of a centralised platform to facilitate the sharing of data in a more
standardised way. All transfer of information would be governed by data sharing agreements. The aim of this platform is
not to give departments access to more information, but to make it easier to send and receive data which they are
entitled to have.

**GDX is not a live service.** GDX currently provides a feed of mock death events and prisoner events.

## Onboarding
See [onboarding instructions for acquirers](acquirer-onboarding) if you would like to receive event
notifications from the service, or [onboarding instructions for suppliers](supplier-onboarding) if you are
supplying events to the service.
