# About the DI Life Event Platform

<%= warning_text("This is not a live service. All data is synthetic test data.") %>

The DI (Digital Identity) Life Event Platform is intended to facilitate cross government data sharing of
citizen life events. All transfer of information would be governed by data sharing agreements. The aim of this platform is
not to give departments access to more information, but to make it easier to send and receive data which they are
entitled to have.

**The Life Event Platform is not a live service.** The platform currently provides a feed of mock death events.

## Onboarding
See [onboarding instructions for acquirers](acquirer-onboarding) if you would like to receive event
notifications from the service, or [onboarding instructions for suppliers](supplier-onboarding) if you are
supplying events to the service.
