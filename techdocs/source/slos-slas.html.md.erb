# Service Level Objectives and Agreements

<%= warning_text("Please note, these are currently draft and have yet to be agreed or signed off.") %>

Service Level Indicators (SLIs) are the metrics used to measure the level of service provided to end users (e.g.,
availability, latency, throughput). Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are the targeted levels of service, measured by
SLIs. Monitoring and alerting will be performed by using Prometheus and Grafana

|                         | Indicator                                                                                                                                                  | Objective                                                               |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aggregated Availability | the percentage of requests served successfully, i.e. 100 * (total requests served successfully 2XX status code / total valid requests 2XX/5XX status code) | >99% of requests to POST /events result in a status 200 (not 500 error) |
| Endpoint response time  | Response time for all API requests, including success and failure                                                                                          | 99th centile of duration in a 24 hour window < 1,000ms                  |
| End to end latency      | Time from event published by a supplier to being consumed by an acquirer                                                                                   | 99th centile of duration in a 24 hour window < 1h                        |
| Service latency         | Time between an event being ingested to being available for an acquirer                                                                                    | 99th centile of duration in a 24 hour window < 5s                       |
| Ingestion availability  | With HMPO, file available with time window                                                                                                                 | -                                                                       |

## Performance Testing

Before go-live, we will test the service at twice an expected load (to approx ~6,000 events) and evaluate against the
above - see [GPC-384](https://govukverify.atlassian.net/browse/GPC-384). In non production environments, the mock data
generation averages 5 events per minute, or 7,200 in 24 hours, but gradually released through the day, so is not
representative of a peak load.

## RPO and RTO

During the private beta, we're aiming for
  
- restoration in business hours, which may be 72 hours (over a weekend)
- loss of up to one hour of metadata/audit data, but acquirers will receieve all data from upstream suppliers, potentially with delay
