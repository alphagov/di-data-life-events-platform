# Onboarding instructions for Acquirers

## Who are these instructions for?
These instructions are for government departments and other public bodies who wish to be notified of specific citizen
life events, and who have a legitimate interest in the information.

## Contact the GDX team
Contact the GDX team by email at

to be issued credentials for a test environment. We will also discuss your specific data and technology needs.

To consume events directly from SQS you will need to create a role in your AWS account which we can grant access to.
Once we have set up queues for you, we will provide you with a queue ARN and a key ARN. You will need to add the following
policy to the role you create (or otherwise grant these permissions):

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
                "sqs:GetQueueUrl",
                "sqs:GetQueueAttributes",
                "sqs:DeleteMessage",
                "sqs:ChangeMessageVisibility"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "<QUEUE_ARN>"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "kms:GenerateDataKey",
                "kms:Decrypt"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "<KEY_ARN>"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
